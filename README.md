# Chuck Norris Fact Generator
"Chuck Norris Fact Generator" is an Android application that displays jokes from the [Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com). Depending on what the user decides, the jokes can either be random or specific. Additionally, there can be multiple random jokes (which the user can also limit to certain categories) displayed at once. The name of the main character of these jokes can even be changed from "Chuck Norris" to anything the user types in.
